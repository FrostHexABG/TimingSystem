# TimingSystem
An ice boat time trial and event management plugin.   
Created by [Makkuusen](https://github.com/Makkuusen/TimingSystem). This fork maintained by the [FrostHexABG Team](https://github.com/FrostHexABG/TimingSystem) for FrostHex.com

## What does it do?
TimingSystem is a plugin that aims to do a few things.
* Creation and time-trials of 3 various track types. [Boats, Elytra and Parkour]
* Displaying leaderboards. In-game holograms and/or command-based ones.
* Creating and managing events to host races. (Currently only supports Boats).

## Installation
First of all you need a Minecraft server running [Paper](https://papermc.io). Then you can get started by following these easy steps:

1. Download the TimingSystem version that is built for your MC server version. If you are running MC 1.21.4 or newer use the [latest release](https://github.com/FrostHexABG/TimingSystem/releases/latest/). If you are running MC 1.21.1 or lower use version [2.3.x](https://github.com/FrostHexABG/TimingSystem/releases/tag/2.3).
2. Add World Edit or [FastAsyncWorldEdit](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fastasyncworldedit.13932/) to your /plugins folder.
3. [Optional] Add [DecentHolograms](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/decentholograms-1-8-1-20-1-papi-support-no-dependencies.96927/) to enable the use of hologram leaderboards.


## Plugin Add-ons
* [TimingSystemNoBoatCollisions](https://github.com/FrostHexABG/TimingSystemNoBoatCollisions) - Removes server side boat collisions. Client side collisions will still occur. This helps players with different pings race together.     
* [TrackExchange](https://github.com/Pigalala/TrackExchange) - Makes it possible to copy and paste tracks on the same server or between different servers.
* [TimingSystemRESTApi](https://github.com/JustBru00/TimingSystemRESTApi) - Adds a basic JSON REST API to the TimingSystem plugin.
* [TimingSystemBlueMap](https://github.com/JustBru00/TimingSystemBlueMap) - Adds TimingSystem track locations to [BlueMap](https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap).

## Recommended client mods
* [OpenBoatUtils](https://modrinth.com/mod/openboatutils/versions) - Enables additional boat behaviours supported by TimingSystem.
* [OinkScoreboard](https://github.com/Pigalala/OinkScoreboard) - Makes it possible to display more than 15 rows for big races.

## For Developers
